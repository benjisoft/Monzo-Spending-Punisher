## Monzo Spending Punisher
### Royal Hackaway v5 Grand Winner

We combined the Monzo Banking API with the Twilio SMS API to passive-aggressively punish you for spending too much money. A text message was sent with varying degrees of passive-aggressiveness depending on how often you spent. The more money you spent, the more passive-aggressive the message was.
